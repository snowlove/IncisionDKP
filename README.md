# IncisionDKP Desktop Application

To integrate MonolithDKP current values, bidding on items, etc to discord.

TODO: 
* Need to find Discord API for C#
* Read values from Monolith SavedVariables.
* Write AddOn to track items during raid to dump to SavedVariables (/reloadui, to trigger flush out) and then post them on discord for bidding via Direct Message.
